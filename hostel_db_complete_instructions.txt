HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATABASE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new file called "hostel_db_complete.sql" in your project
2. Copy the complete SQL code from our conversation into that file
3. Import that SQL file into phpMyAdmin as described below

=== IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
2. Create a new database called "hostel_db" (or drop the existing one first)
3. Select the database and click the "Import" tab
4. Click "Choose File" and select your hostel_db_complete.sql file
5. Make sure "Enable foreign key checks" is UNCHECKED
6. Click "Go" to start the import

The consolidated SQL file contains:
- All core tables (users, courses, rooms, etc.)
- All roommate system tables
- Properly structured views
- Triggers and stored procedures
- Default admin user (username: admin, password: admin)

This single file approach avoids the issues you were experiencing with importing multiple SQL files in sequence.
